Snowball is a scrypt hashcash proof-of-work cryptocurrency cloned from the litecoin code. Snowball aims to grow its user base by employing a multi-level-marketing system, rewarding miners and early adopters. After a pre-mine of 50% of the tokens, mining will continue for three months. Meanwhile, the community will grow through a snowball sytem, where a registered user can invite two of his friends to join and thereby earning a referral reward on each subsequent subscriber. Upon finishing of the mining period, the coin will be traded on an exchange and hence be accessible for the public.

The main goal of this currency is to build up wealth for each user in its community. Users can share their success stories with Snowball on the community blog and post pictures of the parties, cars, houses and whatnot they will be able to fund with their proceeds from this exciting currency.
